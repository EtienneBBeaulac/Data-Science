My name is Etienne Beaulac and I am a French Canadian. Do I like maple syrup? Yes, yes I do. Do I put it on everything? Almost. Why? Because it's __delicious__.

The current structure of the class is created this way to push me to do my best on every assignment. It gives me a certain degree of freedom which helps me go beyond expectations and prove to myself that I can do great things. 
I really like this setup because it resembles the workplace. 

-----------
My goals are to keep improving as much as I can. I want an A. But I also want an A in life. I don't want this to be just another class that I took; I want it to be a springboard.
In order to do so I will make sure to keep doing all of the tasks and case studies on time and having put my pride into each one of them.
