## Python and Big Data

It feels a little strange to be talking about Python in an Rmd file, but the two are growing more similar as time passes. 

I found this article:
http://dataconomy.com/2016/10/big-data-python/

It speaks of multiple ways to handle data in Python, such as Pandas and Bokeh, and gives some practical examples of data exploration using Jupyter Notebooks. It briefly speaks of handling big data using Hadoop and Spark, but does not go into detail about it.

I found this course on Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/spark-and-python-for-big-data-with-pyspark/

It is all about using Spark in conjunction with Python to handle big data, and it seems to be pretty in-depth. It is currently on sale for $13.99 instead of $194.44 which, if it is not just a sale-scam, is a heck of a deal.

It does mention that Spark can be up to 100 times faster than Hadoop in certain situations, and that it usually just faster. It also speaks of different Spark models and technologies.
